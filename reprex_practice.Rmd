Your job is to identify an error, then make a reproducible example that would help future you or someone else understand how to write the code correctly. In other words, your reprex code will *work* and offer a solution to the error thrown in each of the following examples. 

Data are in `AS00601.csv` (and read in correctly below as `mack_creek_vertebrates`).

### Read in the data 

There are no problems here. 
```{r}
mack_creek_vertebrates <- read_csv(here("AS00601.csv"))
```

### reprex 1

Identify what is causing the problem in the code below (there's only one thing). Then, create a very simple reprex that would help yourself, future you, or a colleague fix the problem. **Post your reprex as an issue in your own fork on GitHub.**

```{r}
# Example 1: 
mack_creek_lengths <- mack_creek_vertebrates %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(year:sampledate) %>% 
  filter(section == "CC") %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character, tolower))) %>% 
  drop_na(species) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean_length_cm = mean(length1, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_length_cm = sd(length1, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

### reprex 2

Identify what is causing the problem in the code below (there's only one thing). Then, create a very simple reprex that would help yourself, future you, or a colleague fix the problem. **Post your reprex as an issue in your own fork on GitHub.**

```{r}
# Example 2:
mack_creek_vertebrates %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(species == "ONCL") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = length1, y = weight)) +
         geom_point(aes(shape = 12), color = "purple") +
         theme_minimal() +
         labs(x = "Cutthroat trout length (cm)",
              y = "Weight (g)")
```
